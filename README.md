# Monorepo

## Setup

1. Install Yarn 1.0 or later
2. ...

## Yarn Workspaces

Read the [Yarn Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/)
docs to get familiar with the basic concepts.


### Guidelines

* Every directory in this project should be its own workspace.
* If you need to add a non-workspace directory to version control,
  prefix it with an underscore (e.g. `_save/`) to denote that it is
  NOT a workspace.
